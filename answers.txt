What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge is a way of combining changes from two different branches into one branch. A rebase is a way of rewriting history so that it 
appears as if the changes from one  branch were made on top of another branch. The main difference between a merge and a rebase is 
that a merge preserves the history of the branches, while a rebase rewrites it. This means that if you merge two branches, you can 
still see the changes that were made on each branch, but if you rebase one branch on top of another, you will only be able to see 
the changes that were made on the second branch.
